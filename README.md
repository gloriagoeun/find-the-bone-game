# The "Find the Bone! Return Home!" Game
### A 2D Game created from scratch using Java

Welcome! This repository holds the code I have written to develop a fun little 2D game, called "Find the Bone! Return Home!". The mission of this game is for you, as the dog featured in the picture below, to retrieve 5 bones placed somewhere in the map and return 'HOME' as fast as you can. Along the way, you may also encounter up and down arrow items that will change your speed accordingly, so be aware!

This game was written from scratch with the help from the tutorial/video series by 'How to Make a 2D Game in Java" by RyiSnow on YouTube. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om59cwR7psI&list=PL_QPQmz5C6WUF-pOQDsbsKbaBZqXj4qSq) All of the pixel art and music was created and produced by me through the platforms Piskel (https://www.piskelapp.com/) and BeepBox (www.beepbox.co). Hope you enjoy!
